    # PISP API Overview

    The Payment Initiation API Profile describes the flows and common functionality for the Payment Initiation API, which allows a Payment Initiation Service Provider ('PISP') to:

    - Register an intent to stage a payment-order consent.
    - Optionally confirm available funds for a payment-order
    - Domestic immediate and scheduled (immediate debit) payments only.
    - Subsequently submit the payment-order for processing.
    - Optionally retrieve the status of a payment-order consent or payment-order resource.

    This profile should be read in conjunction with a compatible Read/Write Data API Profile which provides a description of the elements that are common across all the Read/Write Data APIs, and compatible individual resources.

    ## Base URL
    The base URL for all AIS APIs is: `https://rs1.openbanking.api.tide.co:4501/v1.0/open-banking/v3.1/pisp/**`

    ## Supported Payment Types
    The Tide API currently only supports:
    - Domestic Payments
    - Domestic Scheduled Payments
    - Domestic Standing Orders

    The Tide API __does not__ support:
    - International payments
    - File & Bulk payments
    - `payment-details` end-points 

    Payments can only be made to existing beneficiaries.

    ## Overview
    The following apply to all domestic payment consents:

    ### `InstructedAmount/Amount`
    - There is no MAX `InstructedAmount/Amount` mandated by Tide API. 
    - 50,000 GBP is the default maximum when opening a Tide account, but thresholds can be managed by the customer. Tide suggest PISP notify the PSU that the same limits apply as in their Tide app. It is possible from time to time that `domestic-payment-consents` is authorised, but the payment initiation fails due to account limits.

    ### `InstructedAmount/Currency`
    - `InstructedAmount/Currency` must be `GBP`

    ### `RemittanceInformation/Reference` 
    `RemittanceInformation/Reference` is a mandatory field and must adhere to the following:
    - Valid characters:
      - A-Z
      - a-z 
      - 0-9
      - "space" 
      - The characters "&", "-", ".", "/"
    - Contiguous characters – user enters 6 or more valid characters but without contiguous string of at least 6 alphanumeric characters 
    - Must contain a contiguous string of at least 6 alphanumeric characters
    - Homogeneous string – user enters 6 or more valid characters (including valid non-alphanumeric characters) - After stripping out non-alphanumeric characters the resulting string cannot consist of all the same character

    The PISP may also opt to populate reference field on behalf of the PSU

    ### `CreditorAccount`
    <!-- theme: info -->
    > ### Note
    >
    > Domestic-payment-consents will only be authorised if the `CreditorAccount` details are that of an already existing beneficiary i.e. one the PSU has previously created in their app. 
    > If a consent contains recipient info that does not meet this criteria then error will be returned to the front end, the consent will remain in status `AwaitingAuthorisation` and the PSU will not be redirected.

    The PISP can address this in one of two ways:
    - Notify PSU that only payments to existing recipients are permitted and in the event this condition is not met Tide will not authorise the consent and display error modal to user
    - Integrate with Tide beneficiaries API and can confirm that the recipient already exists before sending the consent to allow for a better user experience

    ### `LocalInstrument`
    The only `LocalInstrument` supported is faster payment scheme. This field, if specified, must have the value `UK.OBIE.FPS`. If anything other than this is sent by PISP in consent payload then an error will be returned. 

    However, this field is not mandatory so we suggest PISP simply not include this field and Tide will stage consent as a faster payment.

    ### `Account.SchemeName`
    The only supported `Account.SchemeName` is `UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber` for both `DebtorAccount` and `CreditorAccount`. Any other enum provided will return error.

    ## Scheduled Payment dates
    Payments can be made on all days including Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays

    ## Standing Orders
    - `Initiation/FirstPaymentDateTime` must be no more than 1 calendar year in advance, or PISP will be returned an error
    - `Initiation/FinalPaymentDateTime` must be after Initiation/FirstPaymentDateTime by at least a calendar day, or PISP will be returned error
    - `Initiation/Frequency` supported by Tide are:
      - `IntrvlMnthDay:01:xx`
      - `IntrvlWkDay:01:xx`
    - The following fields are not supported and will return an error if specified:
      - `NumberOfPayments`
      - `RecurringPaymentDateTime`
      - `RecurringPaymentAmount`
      - `FInalPaymentAmount`


    ### `IntrvlMnthDay:01:xx`
    The following rules apply:
    - Same day every month (i.e. if made on 4th May the next payment will be made on the 4th June), however if a payment is made on either the 29th, 30th, 31st of the month and one of the months a payment is scheduled to be in has fewer days than the month of the first payment then that payment will be made on the LAST day of that month. (e.g. first payment on 30th Jan > next payment 28th Feb > next payment 30th March.
    - first two digits after IntrvlMnthDay must be set at '01', indicating a one monthly interval else PISP will be returned error
    - last two digits after IntrvlMnthDay are not considered or validated by Tide (payment will be made as per the day in FirstPaymentDateTime)

    ### `IntrvlWkDay:01:xx`
    The following rules apply.  
    - Same day of the week as the first payment (i.e. if first payment is made on Friday > next payment is made on Friday the following week) - this is number of the week i.e. 1 = monday
    - first two digits after IntrvlMnthWkDay must be set at '01'
    - last two digits after IntrvlMnthWkDay are not taken in to account by Tide (payment will be made as per the day in FirstPaymentDateTime)

                              Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide this reference in the structured remittance information, to enable reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the amount of money.
                              If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference or a payment remit identification, and only one identifier can be passed through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or payment remittance identification should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction identification.
                              OB: The Faster Payments Scheme can only accept 18 characters for the ReferenceInformation field - which is where this ISO field will be mapped.

                              Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide this reference in the structured remittance information, to enable reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the amount of money.
                              If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference or a payment remit identification, and only one identifier can be passed through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or payment remittance identification should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction identification.
